# `APIRouter` class[¶](#apirouter-class "Permanent link")

Here's the reference information for the `APIRouter` class, with all its parameters, attributes and methods.

You can import the `APIRouter` class directly from `fastapi`:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter
```

## fastapi.APIRouter [¶](#fastapi.APIRouter "Permanent link")

```python
APIRouter(
    *,
    prefix="",
    tags=None,
    dependencies=None,
    default_response_class=Default(JSONResponse),
    responses=None,
    callbacks=None,
    routes=None,
    redirect_slashes=True,
    default=None,
    dependency_overrides_provider=None,
    route_class=APIRoute,
    on_startup=None,
    on_shutdown=None,
    lifespan=None,
    deprecated=None,
    include_in_schema=True,
    generate_unique_id_function=Default(generate_unique_id),
    strict_content_type=Default(True)
)
```

Bases: `Router`

`APIRouter` class, used to group *path operations*, for example to structure
an app in multiple files. It would then be included in the `FastAPI` app, or
in another `APIRouter` (ultimately included in the app).

Read more about it in the
[FastAPI docs for Bigger Applications - Multiple Files](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/).

#### Example[¶](#fastapi.APIRouter--example "Permanent link")

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
router = APIRouter()


@router.get("/users/", tags=["users"])
async def read_users():
    return [{"username": "Rick"}, {"username": "Morty"}]


app.include_router(router)
```

| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| `prefix` | An optional path prefix for the router.  **TYPE:** `str`  **DEFAULT:** `''` |
| `tags` | A list of tags to be applied to all the *path operations* in this router.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `list[str | Enum] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `dependencies` | A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to all the *path operations* in this router.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Bigger Applications - Multiple Files](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/#include-an-apirouter-with-a-custom-prefix-tags-responses-and-dependencies).  **TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `default_response_class` | The default response class to be used.  Read more in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#default-response-class).  **TYPE:** `type[Response]`  **DEFAULT:** `Default(JSONResponse)` |
| `responses` | Additional responses to be shown in OpenAPI.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Additional Responses in OpenAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/additional-responses/).  And in the [FastAPI docs for Bigger Applications](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/#include-an-apirouter-with-a-custom-prefix-tags-responses-and-dependencies).  **TYPE:** `dict[int | str, dict[str, Any]] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `callbacks` | OpenAPI callbacks that should apply to all *path operations* in this router.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).  **TYPE:** `list[BaseRoute] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `routes` | **Note**: you probably shouldn't use this parameter, it is inherited from Starlette and supported for compatibility.   ---   A list of routes to serve incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests.  **TYPE:** `list[BaseRoute] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `redirect_slashes` | Whether to detect and redirect slashes in URLs when the client doesn't use the same format.  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `True` |
| `default` | Default function handler for this router. Used to handle 404 Not Found errors.  **TYPE:** `ASGIApp | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `dependency_overrides_provider` | Only used internally by FastAPI to handle dependency overrides.  You shouldn't need to use it. It normally points to the `FastAPI` app object.  **TYPE:** `Any | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `route_class` | Custom route (*path operation*) class to be used by this router.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Request and APIRoute class](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/how-to/custom-request-and-route/#custom-apiroute-class-in-a-router).  **TYPE:** `type[APIRoute]`  **DEFAULT:** `APIRoute` |
| `on_startup` | A list of startup event handler functions.  You should instead use the `lifespan` handlers.  Read more in the [FastAPI docs for `lifespan`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/).  **TYPE:** `Sequence[Callable[[], Any]] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `on_shutdown` | A list of shutdown event handler functions.  You should instead use the `lifespan` handlers.  Read more in the [FastAPI docs for `lifespan`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/).  **TYPE:** `Sequence[Callable[[], Any]] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `lifespan` | A `Lifespan` context manager handler. This replaces `startup` and `shutdown` functions with a single context manager.  Read more in the [FastAPI docs for `lifespan`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/).  **TYPE:** `Lifespan[Any] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `deprecated` | Mark all *path operations* in this router as deprecated.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `bool | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `include_in_schema` | To include (or not) all the *path operations* in this router in the generated OpenAPI.  This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `True` |
| `generate_unique_id_function` | Customize the function used to generate unique IDs for the *path operations* shown in the generated OpenAPI.  This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients or SDKs for your API.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).  **TYPE:** `Callable[[APIRoute], str]`  **DEFAULT:** `Default(generate_unique_id)` |
| `strict_content_type` | Enable strict checking for request Content-Type headers.  When `True` (the default), requests with a body that do not include a `Content-Type` header will **not** be parsed as JSON.  This prevents potential cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks that exploit the browser's ability to send requests without a Content-Type header, bypassing CORS preflight checks. In particular applicable for apps that need to be run locally (in localhost).  When `False`, requests without a `Content-Type` header will have their body parsed as JSON, which maintains compatibility with certain clients that don't send `Content-Type` headers.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Strict Content-Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/strict-content-type/).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `Default(True)` |

##### Example[¶](#fastapi.APIRouter.get--example "Permanent link")

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, FastAPI

@router.get("/items/")
def read_items():
    return [{"name": "Empanada"}, {"name": "Arepa"}]

app.include_router(router)
```

| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | The URL path to be used for this *path operation*.  For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.  **TYPE:** `str` |
| `response_model` | The type to use for the response.  It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.  It will be used for:   * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will   show it as the response (JSON Schema). * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the   `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the   corresponding JSON. * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data   (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object   that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does   not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have   that `password`. * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the   `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the   corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not   valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,   so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an   error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).   Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).  **TYPE:** `Any`  **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)` |
| `status_code` | The default status code to be used for the response.  You could override the status code by returning a response directly.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).  **TYPE:** `int | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `tags` | A list of tags to be applied to the *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags).  **TYPE:** `list[str | Enum] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `dependencies` | A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the *path operation*.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).  **TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `summary` | A summary for the *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `description` | A description for the *path operation*.  If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the *path operation function*.  It can contain Markdown.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_description` | The description for the default response.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `str`  **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'` |
| `responses` | Additional responses that could be returned by this *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `dict[int | str, dict[str, Any]] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `deprecated` | Mark this *path operation* as deprecated.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `bool | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `operation_id` | Custom operation ID to be used by this *path operation*.  By default, it is generated automatically.  If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.  You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_model_include` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).  **TYPE:** `IncEx | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_model_exclude` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).  **TYPE:** `IncEx | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_model_by_alias` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `True` |
| `response_model_exclude_unset` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default.  When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `False` |
| `response_model_exclude_defaults` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset` in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values, they will be excluded from the response.  When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `False` |
| `response_model_exclude_none` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should exclude fields set to `None`.  This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset` and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values when it makes sense.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_exclude_none).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `False` |
| `include_in_schema` | Include this *path operation* in the generated OpenAPI schema.  This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `True` |
| `response_class` | Response class to be used for this *path operation*.  This will not be used if you return a response directly.

            It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to
            be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
            etc.

            It will be used for:

            * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                show it as the response (JSON Schema).
            * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                corresponding JSON.
            * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                that `password`.
            * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

            The type to use for the response.

            It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to
            be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`,
            etc.

            It will be used for:

            * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will
                show it as the response (JSON Schema).
            * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the
                `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the
                corresponding JSON.
            * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data
                (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object
                that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does
                not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have
                that `password`.
            * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the
                `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the
                corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not
                valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,
                so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an
                error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).

If you returned an object   that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does   not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have   that `password`. * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the   `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the   corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not   valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,   so it's an error from the API developer.

##### Example[¶](#fastapi.APIRouter.delete--example "Permanent link")

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
router = APIRouter()

@router.delete("/items/{item_id}")
def delete_item(item_id: str):
    return {"message": "Item deleted"}

app.include_router(router)
```

| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | The URL path to be used for this *path operation*.  For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.  **TYPE:** `str` |
| `response_model` | The type to use for the response.  It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.  It will be used for:   * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will   show it as the response (JSON Schema). * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the   `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the   corresponding JSON. * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data   (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object   that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does   not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have   that `password`. * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the   `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the   corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not   valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,   so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an   error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).   Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).  **TYPE:** `Any`  **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)` |
| `status_code` | The default status code to be used for the response.  You could override the status code by returning a response directly.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).  **TYPE:** `int | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `tags` | A list of tags to be applied to the *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags).  **TYPE:** `list[str | Enum] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `dependencies` | A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the *path operation*.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).  **TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `summary` | A summary for the *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `description` | A description for the *path operation*.  If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the *path operation function*.  It can contain Markdown.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_description` | The description for the default response.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `str`  **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'` |
| `responses` | Additional responses that could be returned by this *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `dict[int | str, dict[str, Any]] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `deprecated` | Mark this *path operation* as deprecated.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `bool | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `operation_id` | Custom operation ID to be used by this *path operation*.  By default, it is generated automatically.  If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.  You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_model_include` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).  **TYPE:** `IncEx | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_model_exclude` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).  **TYPE:** `IncEx | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_model_by_alias` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `True` |
| `response_model_exclude_unset` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default.  When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `False` |
| `response_model_exclude_defaults` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset` in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values, they will be excluded from the response.  When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `False` |
| `response_model_exclude_none` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should exclude fields set to `None`.  This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset` and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values when it makes sense.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_exclude_none).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `False` |
| `include_in_schema` | Include this *path operation* in the generated OpenAPI schema.  This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `True` |
| `response_class` | Response class to be used for this *path operation*.  This will not be used if you return a response directly.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#redirectresponse).  **TYPE:** `type[Response]`  **DEFAULT:** `Default(JSONResponse)` |
| `name` | Name for this *path operation*. Only used internally.  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `callbacks` | List of *path operations* that will be used as OpenAPI callbacks.  This is only for OpenAPI documentation, the callbacks won't be used directly.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).  **TYPE:** `list[BaseRoute] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Advanced Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/path-operation-advanced-configuration/#custom-openapi-path-operation-schema).  **TYPE:** `dict[str, Any] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `generate_unique_id_function` | Customize the function used to generate unique IDs for the *path operations* shown in the generated OpenAPI.  This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients or SDKs for your API.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).  **TYPE:** `Callable[[APIRoute], str]`  **DEFAULT:** `Default(generate_unique_id)` |

| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | The URL path to be used for this *path operation*.  For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.  **TYPE:** `str` |
| `response_model` | The type to use for the response.  It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.  It will be used for:   * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will   show it as the response (JSON Schema). * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the   `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the   corresponding JSON. * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data   (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object   that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does   not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have   that `password`. * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the   `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the   corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not   valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,   so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an   error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).   Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).  **TYPE:** `Any`  **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)` |
| `status_code` | The default status code to be used for the response.  You could override the status code by returning a response directly.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).  **TYPE:** `int | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `tags` | A list of tags to be applied to the *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags).  **TYPE:** `list[str | Enum] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `dependencies` | A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the *path operation*.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).  **TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `summary` | A summary for the *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `description` | A description for the *path operation*.  If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the *path operation function*.  It can contain Markdown.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_description` | The description for the default response.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `str`  **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'` |
| `responses` | Additional responses that could be returned by this *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `dict[int | str, dict[str, Any]] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `deprecated` | Mark this *path operation* as deprecated.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `bool | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `operation_id` | Custom operation ID to be used by this *path operation*.  By default, it is generated automatically.  If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.  You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_model_include` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).  **TYPE:** `IncEx | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_model_exclude` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to exclude certain fields in the response data.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).  **TYPE:** `IncEx | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_model_by_alias` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response model should be serialized by alias when an alias is used.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `True` |
| `response_model_exclude_unset` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default.  When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `False` |
| `response_model_exclude_defaults` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that have the same value as the default. This is different from `response_model_exclude_unset` in that if the fields are set but contain the same default values, they will be excluded from the response.  When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `False` |
| `response_model_exclude_none` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should exclude fields set to `None`.  This is much simpler (less smart) than `response_model_exclude_unset` and `response_model_exclude_defaults`. You probably want to use one of those two instead of this one, as those allow returning `None` values when it makes sense.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_exclude_none).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `False` |
| `include_in_schema` | Include this *path operation* in the generated OpenAPI schema.  This affects the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Query Parameters and String Validations](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params-str-validations/#exclude-parameters-from-openapi).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `True` |
| `response_class` | Response class to be used for this *path operation*.  This will not be used if you return a response directly.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Custom Response - HTML, Stream, File, others](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/custom-response/#redirectresponse).  **TYPE:** `type[Response]`  **DEFAULT:** `Default(JSONResponse)` |
| `name` | Name for this *path operation*. Only used internally.  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `callbacks` | List of *path operations* that will be used as OpenAPI callbacks.  This is only for OpenAPI documentation, the callbacks won't be used directly.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for OpenAPI Callbacks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/openapi-callbacks/).  **TYPE:** `list[BaseRoute] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `openapi_extra` | Extra metadata to be included in the OpenAPI schema for this *path operation*.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Advanced Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/path-operation-advanced-configuration/#custom-openapi-path-operation-schema).  **TYPE:** `dict[str, Any] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `generate_unique_id_function` | Customize the function used to generate unique IDs for the *path operations* shown in the generated OpenAPI.  This is particularly useful when automatically generating clients or SDKs for your API.

| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | The URL path to be used for this *path operation*.  For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.  **TYPE:** `str` |
| `response_model` | The type to use for the response.  It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.  It will be used for:   * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will   show it as the response (JSON Schema). * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the   `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the   corresponding JSON. * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data   (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object   that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does   not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have   that `password`. * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the   `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the   corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not   valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,   so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an   error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).   Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).  **TYPE:** `Any`  **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)` |
| `status_code` | The default status code to be used for the response.  You could override the status code by returning a response directly.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).  **TYPE:** `int | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `tags` | A list of tags to be applied to the *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags).  **TYPE:** `list[str | Enum] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `dependencies` | A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the *path operation*.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).  **TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `summary` | A summary for the *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `description` | A description for the *path operation*.  If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the *path operation function*.  It can contain Markdown.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_description` | The description for the default response.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `str`  **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'` |
| `responses` | Additional responses that could be returned by this *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `dict[int | str, dict[str, Any]] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `deprecated` | Mark this *path operation* as deprecated.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `bool | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `operation_id` | Custom operation ID to be used by this *path operation*.  By default, it is generated automatically.  If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.  You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_model_include` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).  **TYPE:** `IncEx | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |

Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `True` |
| `response_model_exclude_unset` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to define if the response data should have all the fields, including the ones that were not set and have their default values. This is different from `response_model_exclude_defaults` in that if the fields are set, they will be included in the response, even if the value is the same as the default.  When `True`, default values are omitted from the response.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#use-the-response_model_exclude_unset-parameter).  **TYPE:** `bool`  **DEFAULT:** `False` |

| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | The URL path to be used for this *path operation*.  For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.  **TYPE:** `str` |
| `response_model` | The type to use for the response.  It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.  It will be used for:   * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will   show it as the response (JSON Schema). * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the   `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the   corresponding JSON. * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data   (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object   that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does   not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have   that `password`. * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the   `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the   corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not   valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,   so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an   error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).   Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).  **TYPE:** `Any`  **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)` |
| `status_code` | The default status code to be used for the response.  You could override the status code by returning a response directly.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).  **TYPE:** `int | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `tags` | A list of tags to be applied to the *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags).  **TYPE:** `list[str | Enum] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `dependencies` | A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the *path operation*.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).  **TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `summary` | A summary for the *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `description` | A description for the *path operation*.  If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the *path operation function*.  It can contain Markdown.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_description` | The description for the default response.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `str`  **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'` |
| `responses` | Additional responses that could be returned by this *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `dict[int | str, dict[str, Any]] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `deprecated` | Mark this *path operation* as deprecated.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `bool | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `operation_id` | Custom operation ID to be used by this *path operation*.  By default, it is generated automatically.  If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.  You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_model_include` | Configuration passed to Pydantic to include only certain fields in the response data.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model - Return Type](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/#response_model_include-and-response_model_exclude).  **TYPE:** `IncEx | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |

| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | The URL path to be used for this *path operation*.  For example, in `http://example.com/items`, the path is `/items`.  **TYPE:** `str` |
| `response_model` | The type to use for the response.  It could be any valid Pydantic *field* type. So, it doesn't have to be a Pydantic model, it could be other things, like a `list`, `dict`, etc.  It will be used for:   * Documentation: the generated OpenAPI (and the UI at `/docs`) will   show it as the response (JSON Schema). * Serialization: you could return an arbitrary object and the   `response_model` would be used to serialize that object into the   corresponding JSON. * Filtering: the JSON sent to the client will only contain the data   (fields) defined in the `response_model`. If you returned an object   that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does   not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have   that `password`. * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the   `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the   corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not   valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,   so it's an error from the API developer. So, FastAPI will raise an   error and return a 500 error code (Internal Server Error).   Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Model](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-model/).  **TYPE:** `Any`  **DEFAULT:** `Default(None)` |
| `status_code` | The default status code to be used for the response.  You could override the status code by returning a response directly.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Response Status Code](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/response-status-code/).  **TYPE:** `int | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `tags` | A list of tags to be applied to the *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/#tags).  **TYPE:** `list[str | Enum] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `dependencies` | A list of dependencies (using `Depends()`) to be applied to the *path operation*.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Dependencies in path operation decorators](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/dependencies-in-path-operation-decorators/).  **TYPE:** `Sequence[Depends] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `summary` | A summary for the *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `description` | A description for the *path operation*.  If not provided, it will be extracted automatically from the docstring of the *path operation function*.  It can contain Markdown.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs for Path Operation Configuration](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-operation-configuration/).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `response_description` | The description for the default response.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `str`  **DEFAULT:** `'Successful Response'` |
| `responses` | Additional responses that could be returned by this *path operation*.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `dict[int | str, dict[str, Any]] | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `deprecated` | Mark this *path operation* as deprecated.  It will be added to the generated OpenAPI (e.g. visible at `/docs`).  **TYPE:** `bool | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
| `operation_id` | Custom operation ID to be used by this *path operation*.  By default, it is generated automatically.  If you provide a custom operation ID, you need to make sure it is unique for the whole API.  You can customize the operation ID generation with the parameter `generate_unique_id_function` in the `FastAPI` class.  Read more about it in the [FastAPI docs about how to Generate Clients](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/generate-clients/#custom-generate-unique-id-function).  **TYPE:** `str | None`  **DEFAULT:** `None` |
